Introducing the RecipeFinder app, your go-to solution for finding and saving your favorite recipes. With RecipeFinder, you can search for recipes based on ingredients or recipe names, view recipe details, and save recipes to your favorites list.

Upon opening the app, you'll be greeted by the home screen where you can search for recipes. Type in the name of the recipe you're looking for or the ingredient you have on hand, and RecipeFinder will display a list of matching recipes from the Edamam Recipe Search API.

Tap on a recipe from the list to view its details, including the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions. If you find a recipe you love, simply tap the "favorite" button to save it to your favorites list.

To access your saved recipes, head over to the favorites screen where you'll find a list of all your favorites. Swipe left on a recipe to remove it from your list
